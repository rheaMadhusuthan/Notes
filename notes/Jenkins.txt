- Open source automation server
- multiple plugins to support building, deployment and automating any project
- Jenkins can be downloaded as read only images (docker image) and run on docker container when needed
- Jenkins can be deployed on ec2 machines or docker
    - docker is better because of flat rate pricing and a fixed number of nodes
    - can install jenkins using docker, standalone, kubernetes
- Jenkins follow master slave(nodes) architecture
- can achieve CI/CD (continuous integration / continuous deployment)
- blue green deployment
    - create 2 separate but identical env (blue, green)
    - if blue is running with current application, green will run with new app version
    - after testing, blue is deprecated
    - reduces deployment risk, easy roll back, increase availability
